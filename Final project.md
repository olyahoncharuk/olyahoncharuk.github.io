#My Final readme file!
My final project creation started with an issue. I created a website, but I lost the HTML file for it. So, I had to go to a tutor... He helped me with finding my HTML file and setting up some basic preferences. 

After that, I decided what the concept of my website would be. I created a css file and started designing my webpage. I chose a light blue color for all of my pages and assigned it in my css file.

I have the main font for the text, which is Copperplate. I used it for text in yellow and purple colors. 

It wasn't really challenging for me to work with text design in css file, but it was hard to figure out how to put text in one row with pictures. I went to the tutor again and he helped me to find the right code for that.

Also, last week in class we figured out that I put my files in the wrong repo and branch. So, thank you for your help with that!

On my website, you can find links to three other pages. All of them contain different information.

*They are: My Family, Kyiv Life, Boston Life.*

I added links also during the tutor session listing them in the main html file, then I changed them in css files. At first, they were dark blue and underlined.
Recently, I changed the color to bright blue ( marking them a{}). After, with code a:hover{text-decoration: underline;} I made them underlined after you put a cursor on it.

On every page, there is the main page link. I made it moving from the right to the left. It's crazy. I think it is the coolest thing I have on my webpage. I found the code doing my own research. And it is possible with function <marquee direction="left">................... YOU CAN ALSO DO IT HERE. I DIDN'T KNOW...............</marquee>
#Anyways

My project has 4 HTML files and one css. And also a lot of pictures and one video.

1. The main page has an edited picture of myself and a photo collage of my whole family.
2. My Family page will present all my family members with info about them.
3. Kyiv Life page has pictures (taken back home) with a description.
4. Boston Life page also has pictures with a description of my life here. Also, the page has one video! I figured out how to add it with the tutor.

But I have one issue with My Family page. I couldn't put more pictures after the picture of my mum. I actually couldn't put anything after that. I think the issue occurred when I was pushing changes to my branch after I added the picture. Unfortunately, I don't know how to solve this problem, but I put a percentage of the completion bar before the picture so that everyone knows it's not done(I put only 10%).

In conclusion, I would say that I do have some concerns about my website. I'm worried that My Family page is not ready and that links to other pages will move if I will show my website on the big screen. BUT, I'm really happy about how it turned out, as it is my first experience making a website by myself!
